/*
Create a class called Calculator. Given two double variables named n1 and n2 and a char
variable named mathOperator, write a program that calculates the result of n1 and n2 based on
the given math operator.

		char operator -> -, +, *, /

		When the operator is +: add n1, n2
		When the operator is -: subtract n1, n2
		When the operator is *: multiply n1, n2
		When the operator is /: divide n1, n2
		For any other operators, print "invalid operator."

            Example:
                  n1 = 10, n2 = 20, mathOperator = '+'

            Output:
                  30
